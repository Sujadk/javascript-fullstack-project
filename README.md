GiftLink Application
Introduction
Welcome to GiftLink, an application designed to connect users who wish to give away household items they no longer need with users who enjoy recycling and prefer to find free household items to match their taste rather than purchasing new ones.

Functionality
The GiftLink application facilitates the process of giving away and finding household items by providing the following features:

Listing Items: Users can easily list household items they wish to give away by providing a description, category, and optionally, a photo.
Browsing Listings: Users can browse through available listings to find items they are interested in. They can filter listings based on categories or search for specific items.
Contacting Users: Once users find an item they are interested in, they can contact the owner of the item through the application to arrange for pickup or delivery.
Matching Preferences: Users can set preferences for the types of items they are interested in, helping them find relevant listings more efficiently.
